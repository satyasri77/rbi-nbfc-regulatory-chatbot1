However, in respect of EMI based floating rate personal loans, in the wake of rising interest rates, several consumer grievances related to elongation of loan tenor and/or increase in EMI amount, without proper communication with and/or consent of the borrowers have been received. In order to address these concerns, NBFCs are advised to put in place an appropriate policy framework meeting the following requirements for implementation and compliance: (i) At the time of sanction, NBFCs shall clearly communicate to the borrowers about the possible impact of change in benchmark interest rate on the loan leading to changes in EMI and/or tenor or both. Subsequently, any increase in the EMI/ tenor or both on account of the above shall be communicated to the borrower immediately through appropriate channels. (ii) At the time of reset of interest rates, NBFCs shall provide the option to the borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their Board approved policy. The policy, inter alia, may also specify the number of times a borrower will be allowed to switch during the tenor of the loan.

Illustrations on treatment for multiple NBFCs in the Group - Classification in Middle Layer Example 1 - There are seven NBFCs in a Group \u2013 an NBFC-ICC with asset size of \u20b9300 crore, an HFC with asset size of \u20b9300 crore, an NBFC-IFC with asset size of \u20b9500 crore, an NBFC-MFI with asset size of \u20b9100 crore, an NBFC-P2P with asset size of \u20b950 crore and NBFC without public funds and customer interface with asset size of \u20b970 crore. How will these NBFCs be classified in various layers? Explanation \u2013 On a standalone basis, as per SBR Regulatory Framework, \uf0b7 HFCs and IFCs will, by default, be included in the Middle Layer but may move to the Upper Layer based on the supervisory filtering process. \uf0b7 NBFC-ICC and NBFC-MFI will be classified in Base Layer (as their asset size constitutes less than \u20b91000 crore in the example). \uf0b7 NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will, by default, be included in the Base Layer. Based on consolidation of assets of all the NBFCs in the Group, the consolidated asset size of NBFCs in the Group becomes \u20b91320 crore (higher than the asset size threshold of \u20b91000 core for classification in Middle Layer). As such, NBFC-ICC and NBFC-MFI will be classified in the Middle Layer. HFC and IFC will continue to be classified in the Middle Layer in this example. However, NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will continue to be classified in the Base Layer. Example 2 - If the asset size of NBFC-ICC in the above example is \u20b910 crore, then would it be still classified in Middle Layer? Explanation - Yes, both NBFC-ICC and NBFC-MFI would still be classified in Middle Layer as the consolidated asset size of NBFCs in the Group at \u20b91030 crore is higher than the asset size threshold of \u20b91000 core for Middle Layer.",

For this purpose, the erosion in the fair value of the advance shall be computed as the difference between the fair value of the loan before and after restructuring.

Fair value of the loan after restructuring shall be computed as the present value of cash flows representing the interest at the rate charged on the advance on restructuring and the principal, discounted at a rate equal to the NBFC's bare lending rate as applicable to the borrower as on the date of restructuring. The above formula moderates the swing in the diminution of present value of loans with the interest rate cycle and shall have to be followed consistently by NBFCs in future. Further, it is reiterated that the provisions required as above arise due to the action of the NBFCs resulting in change in contractual terms of the loan upon restructuring which are in the nature of financial concessions. These provisions are distinct from the provisions which are linked to the asset classification of the account classified as NPA and reflect the impairment due to deterioration in the credit quality of the loan.

However, the total sacrifice involved for the NBFC would be NPV of the above portion plus valuation loss on account of conversion into debt/equity instruments. NBFCs are therefore advised that they shall correctly capture the diminution in fair value of restructured accounts as it shall have a bearing not only on the provisioning required to be made by them but also on the amount of sacrifice required from the promoters (ref. paragraph 7.6). Further, there must not be any effort on the part of NBFCs to artificially reduce the net present value of cash flows by resorting to any sort of financial engineering. NBFCs shall put in place a proper mechanism of checks and balances to ensure accurate calculation of erosion in the fair value of restructured accounts.

This means even if only one of the facilities/accounts of a borrower has been restructured, the NBFC shall also disclose the entire outstanding amount pertaining to all the facilities/accounts of that particular borrower. The disclosure format prescribed in Appendix III-D, inter-alia, includes the following: (i) Details of accounts restructured on a cumulative basis excluding the standard restructured accounts which cease to attract higher provision and risk weight (if applicable); (ii) Provisions made on restructured accounts under various categories; and (iii) Details of movement of restructured accounts. This implies that once the higher provisions on restructured advances (classified as standard either ab initio or on upgradation from NPA category) revert to the normal level on account of satisfactory performance during the prescribed period, such advances shall no longer be required to be disclosed by NBFCs as restructured accounts in the \"Notes on Accounts\" in their Annual Balance Sheets. However, the provision for diminution in the fair value of restructured accounts on such restructured accounts shall continue to be maintained by NBFCs as per the existing instructions.",

In the cases of roll-over of short-term loans, where proper pre-sanction assessment has been made, and the roll-over is allowed based on the actual requirement of the borrower and no concession has been provided due to credit weakness of the borrower, then these shall not be considered as restructured accounts. However, if such accounts are rolled- over more than two times, then third roll-over onwards the account shall be treated as a restructured account.

Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect an NBFC's financial condition. The changes in interest rates affect NBFCs in a larger way. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on NBFC's earnings (i.e. reported profits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest rates is on NBFC's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of NBFC's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in market interest rates. The interest rate risk when viewed from these two perspectives is known as \u2018earnings perspective\u2019 and \u2018economic value perspective', respectively. The risk from the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in the Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM).

Protection shall be reckoned as available to the NBFC only if the mismatched assets meet the requirements specified in paragraph 2.10 above. (ii) Maturity mismatches: The NBFC shall be eligible to reckon the amount of protection if the maturity of the credit derivative contract were to be equal to the maturity of the underlying asset. If, however, the maturity of the CDS contract is less than the maturity of the underlying asset, then it shall be construed as a maturity mismatch. In case of maturity mismatch the amount of protection shall be determined in the following manner: (a) If the residual maturity of the credit derivative product is less than three months no protection shall be recognized. (b) If the residual maturity of the credit derivative contract is three months or more protection proportional to the period for which it is available shall be recognised. When there is a maturity mismatch the following adjustment shall be applied.

Considering the unique nature of the balance sheet of the NBFCs, stressed cash flows is computed by assigning a predefined stress percentage to the overall cash inflows and cash outflows. Total expected cash outflows (stressed outflows) are calculated by multiplying the outstanding balances of various categories or types of liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by 115 percent (15 percent being the rate at which they are expected to run off further or be drawn down). Total expected cash inflows (stressed inflows) are calculated by multiplying the outstanding balances of various categories of contractual receivables by 75 percent (25 percent being the rate at which they are expected to under-flow).

While the Reserve Bank carries out due diligence on Directors before issuing CoR to an NBFC, it is necessary that NBFCs put in place an internal supervisory process on a continuing basis. Further, in order to streamline and bring in uniformity in the process of due diligence, while appointing Directors, NBFCs shall ensure that the procedures mentioned below are followed and minimum criteria are fulfilled by the persons before they are appointed on the Boards: (i) NBFCs shall undertake a process of due diligence to determine the suitability of the person for appointment/continuing to hold appointment as a director on the Board, based upon qualification, expertise, track record, integrity and other \u2018fit and proper\u2019 criteria. NBFCs shall obtain necessary information and declaration from the proposed / existing directors for the purpose in the format given at Appendix XXIII-A. (ii) The process of due diligence shall be undertaken by the NBFCs at the time of appointment/ renewal of appointment. (iii) The Boards of the NBFCs shall constitute Nomination and Remuneration Committees62 to scrutinize the declarations. (iv) Based on the information provided in the signed declaration, Nomination and Remuneration Committees 63 shall decide on the acceptance or otherwise of the Directors, where considered necessary. (v) NBFCs shall obtain annually as on 31st March a simple declaration from the Directors that the information already provided has not undergone change and where there is any change, requisite details are furnished by them forthwith. (vi) The Board of the NBFC must ensure in public interest that the nominated/elected Directors execute the Deeds of Covenants in the format given in Appendix",
